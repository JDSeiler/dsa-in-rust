# NOTE
This is on hold for now! I need some time to study and practice Rust
in order to really advance with this, but the semester is just too busy
for me to spend time on it.
# Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust
## Data Structures
### Linear Structures
1. Stack (using Vec)
2. 'Static' Queue (aka using a Vec instead of a Linked List)
### Graphs
1. Directed Graph
## Algorithms
TODO
## TODO
1. ArrayList (not a trivial task, as it requires manual pointer managment...)
2. Stack (using ArrayList)
2. Linked List
3. Queue (using Linked List)

and many more...
